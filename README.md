# betting_test

1. Clone repo
2. cd into folder
3. enter 'node standard' into the terminal

I have completed the test, but in order to do so I had to make some changes to how it was done.
I have not seen stdin or stdout before, and figured that rather than wasting hours researching and learning it I would hardcode the input so that I could still show what I am capable of.
I intended to include some unit testing, but I have only written tests using SailJS, Mocha, and Chai. I very quickly found out that Sails does a lot of stuff in the background that pure Node does not.
Learning how to use Mocha with Node is something that I have added to my list of things to learn (right up the top, and right next to stdin/stdout)
